<h2>Communism's Biography</h2>
<p>   The band members include: Q. Dot (me), K. Dot, J. Dot, and E. Dot. 
We are started back in the mad city of San Jose; where we represented the East Side.
The band kinda just all started when I went to K's house. He and I were best friends even before music, but I went to his house, and he had this cool beat,
and then he started rapping to it. I was literally stunned by him, and then I came along too rapping afterwards. That was pretty much the creation of the us. 
Just me and him. We soon decided to take the group serious, and we made other songs along the way.
</p>

<p>   We then had this one gig at this trap house, and dang it was crazy.
That was when we met J. Dot and E. Dot. They had a band before us, and after seeing us perform, they wanted us to join along with them or like have a collaboration.
I said yes, and we soon made more songs. That was when K. Dot recommended if we just might as well have a group together, and that was how it came to be. 
	</p>
	
	<p>I think we got the name of “Communism” because of our personal lives. Growing up in San Jose was something crazy. The violence here is what affected us. No one wants to grow up in violence, but that is how the world works.
	I could’ve just said I seen a lot of people die, robberies, and stuff like that, but that’s not my intentions.  I rather talk about the problems and solutions to it, and make sure that people get that message. 
	E. Dot then just pretty much thought of us being called Communism after we told our stories to each other. At first we were like “No, Why in the world...“ After a while it became clear to us why that name suited us. 
	Going back on my message to people, I feel like music is what saves us. There’s a lot of raw talent here, and so like, it’s become a strange thing. People get so lost into their music, they aren’t the people they know anymore.
	Music has a thing that affects the way you think. That’s pretty why we name our first album “For the Music, not the Individuals”
